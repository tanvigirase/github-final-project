# Simple Interest Calculator

A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

## Input
- `p` : principal amount  
- `t` : time period in years  
- `r` : annual rate of interest  

## Output
- `simple interest = p * t * r / 100`

### Example
If principal = 1000, rate = 10, time = 2  
Then **Simple Interest = 1000 * 10 * 2 / 100 = 200**
